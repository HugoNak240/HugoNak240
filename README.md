Greetings, 

My name is <u>Hugo Nakano</u> and I'm interested in utilizing python to work on large  data sets. So far, I've used python to create a text based application to copy a collection of files to multiple directories. Currently, I'm developing a Django application to extract, transform, and load environmental data sets. <b>Python</b> is what I'm used to working it. Please reach out if you'd like to colaborate on a project. Thank You!
